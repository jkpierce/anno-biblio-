title = {{Advection and dispersion of bedload tracers}},
year = {2017},
annote = {This is a nice physics-like paper. They take the Charru 2004 model for advection of bedload tracers and solve it both numerically and exactly in asympototic regimes. They note super-super diffusion (to use G Parker's term) at short timescales and Brownian diffusion (I think) at long timescales. They analyze scaling behavior of mean tracer position, variance of tracer position, and skew of tracer position, and find two scaling regimes in each. These analyses all applied for steady transport conditions. They extended their analysis to unsteady flow conditions as one finds in nature by incorporating an intermittency factor which rescales time using the fraction of above-threshold flows. They also eliminate time from the scaling equations on variance and skew, expressing variance as a function of travel distance. "According to
this model, it should be possible to estimate the particle flight
length and the average bed load transport rate from the evo-
lution of the variance and the skewness of a plume of tracers
in a river."}

annote = {This is a long duration video observation of bedload transport. A nice quote from the introduction: many empirical and phenomenological formulations for predicting solid discharge in open channels have been proposed. However, the estimates of the solid transport rate using these conventional equations proved to be highly uncertain [e.g., Gomez and Church, 1989; Martin, 2003], leading to increased attention to the small-scale details of sediment transport, which could help in advancing the existing relationships." They also note several observations that bedload velocity is only weakly dependent on shear stress conditions at the bed, meaning activity or concentration fluctuations drive sediment transport fluctuations. This is in agreement with Ancey 2008. They measure water flow in 1D with ADV. They find an inertial range with -5/3 exponent. They find scaling behavior in sediment concentration fluctuations: exponent -5/3 was obtained characteristic of the fluid and concentration profiles. The experiment observed dyed tracer grains from above at low transport stages with no sediment recirculation.}

Number fluctuations in the ith cell are considered the result of four factors: (1) transport into the cell from its neighboring upstream cell; (2) individual or collective entrainment within the cell; (3) deposition within the cell; and (4) migration out of the cell to the neighboring cell downstream.}

This is used to introduce an overarching problem termed 'lack of closure' to stochastic models. Closure is the relationship between the parameters required by advection diffusion forumations of sediment transport rate to measurable channel parameters. In this paper Heyman presents an experiment where particle motion was tracked from the side. Median background subtraction was employed to get particle velocity and acceleration distributions. There are a few unique contributions such as average particle velocity as a function of particle elevation. Two methods are described for calculating particle diffusivity. Analysis of particle properties seems to follow something similar to Ballio et al 2018, involving Gaussian smoothing kernels.}

resting phase, and the second is a movement phase. The parameter relevant to the resting phase
is the time spent there, the resting time. The parameter relevant to the movement phase is the
distance covered within it, the particle hop length. Time spent in motion was considered irrelevant,
since the time spent in motion is very short relative to resting time. Within this formulation, the
travel distance of a tracer particle in a time interval emerges from considering the phase to phase
switching, in which one accounts for the total of all hop distances and the total of all resting times
through the switching which occurred in the time interval.}
